# Proper Commenting / Committing / Architecture Example in Python

See the general readme in the root of the project for a general description of what is in this sub-project.

Commenting notes:
 - Each file has a comment header block at the top of the file.
 - Each function and class has a docstring explaining its purpose and usage.
 - Each function docstring includes information about parameters and return values.
 - Each class docstring includes information about attributes and methods.
 - If param or return types are not obvious from the context, type hints are used for clarity.
 - Note that if :param, :return, :note, or :raises: are not used they are listed but marked as 'na'.
This is not typically necessary or advised for professional code but is done here and **required** for
academic purposes.
 - The rule for professional Python code commenting is to be brief, do not comment what is obvious.
However, for academic purposes, more detailed comments are required as a learning exercise.

usage: `python main.py`
